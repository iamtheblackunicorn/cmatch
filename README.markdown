# CMATCH :art: :artist:

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/cmatch/actions/workflows/vue.yml/badge.svg)

***A small color matching app written in Vue.js. :art: :artist:***

## ABOUT :books:

As an artist, I often find myself wondering about good color schemes. To address this problem, I wrote a small web app that gives you a complementary color in hex from a source color in hex.
