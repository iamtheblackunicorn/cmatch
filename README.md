# CMATCH :black_nib: :ribbon:

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/cmatch/actions/workflows/vue.yml/badge.svg)

***A small Vue.js app to inspire writers.*** :black_nib: :ribbon:

## ABOUT :books:

As an artist, I often find myself wondering about good color schemes, for this I wrote a small webapp that gives you a complementary color as a hexadecimal if you put a color into the input field in hexadecimal format too.
